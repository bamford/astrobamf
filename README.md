=========

*A horrifically random collection of (mostly Python) code I have written over the past decade to do stuff.*

There is lots of useful code in here.  Especially for me.  Possibly for you.
There is probably also quite a lot of code that is either half finished, broken, depends on ancient modules,
or offers functionality that is now provided by more official sources.

Code that I have appropriated from the interweb will often, though unfortunately not always,
be accompanied by a comment saying where I got it from.  All such code should be considered to be distributed
under the terms of its original license (if any).  Greatest apologies if I have inadvertantly contravened
any such terms through a combination of enthusiasm and laziness.

With the above proviso, the code in this repository is made available under the [CRAPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamford/astrobamf/master/CRAPL-LICENSE) license (in spirit)
and the [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamford/astrobamf/master/LICENSE) (in seriousness).

If you have any questions or issues with the code, please get in touch.
