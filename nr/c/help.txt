1.  WHAT IS THIS DISKETTE?

     This diskette contains machine-readable C routines from the 
book "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing," 
Second Edition, published by Cambridge University Press (1992).  If 
you do not have the book, this diskette will not be very useful to you, 
since the routine listings on this diskette do not repeat the book's 
explanations or line-by-line program comments.  This diskette also 
contains the Example programs from the "Numerical Recipes Example 
Book (C)".  Details on how to order these books and other items are 
given below.

2.  HOW TO INSTALL THE NUMERICAL RECIPES FILES

The Numerical Recipes routines consist of more than 600 individual 
files (including both the recipes and the example routines).  Fully 
unpacked, this large number of files requires excessive disk space, 
and, on many Macintosh machines, terribly degrades the performance 
of the Finder: On some machines it can take several minutes just to 
open a folder containing more than a few hundred icons.

Luckily, few users ever want to use more than a small number of the 
routines at any one time.  We therefore supply the routines in the 
form of a small number of compressed Stuffit archive (".sit") files. 
We also supply a version of the UnStuffIt unpacking program.  WE 
STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU UNPACK INDIVIDUAL NUMERICAL 
RECIPES FILES ONLY AS YOU NEED THEM.  On request, UnStuffIt will 
create a copy of any desired routine.  You can use, modify, or delete 
copy: a fresh copy can always be obtained by again using UnStuffIt.

To install the Numerical Recipes archives, simply create an 
appropriately named folder on your hard disk, and drag all the files 
from this Numerical Recipes C Diskette into that folder. 

Here is how to unpack one or more routines from the archives: 
Double-click on the UnStuffIt utility.  When UnStuffIt comes to life, 
select its File/Open Archive menu item, and open the desired archive 
(Recipes, Demos, or Other) in the appropriate drive and folder.  After 
a short delay, you will be presented with a window listing all the 
procedures.  Scroll through this list and click on those that you wish 
to unpack (use Command-Click to select more than one at a time, or 
Shift-Click to select a range), or use the menu item Edit/Select All 
if you want to unpack all the procedures.  Now click the Extract 
command at the bottom of the window.  Use its dialog window, first 
to display the interior of your desired destination folder, and 
second, to initiate the unpacking (click on Save All).  When the 
unpacking is completed, select the menu item File/Close to close the 
archive.

3.  ANSI vs. K&R C   (IMPORTANT: BE SURE TO READ THIS SECTION)

There are two dialects of the C language commonly in use.  The older 
one is called Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R) C or "traditional" C.  
Virtually all C compilers for Macintosh can compile K&R C.  The 
newer dialect, which is fast replacing K&R C, is called ANSI C.  The 
program listings in the Numerical Recipes books are all in 
ANSI C.  However, at present, not all C compilers are ANSI 
compatible.  

That is why this product is supplied as two diskettes.  Each diskette 
is complete and can be used without any files from the other.  If you 
are sure that you want K&R C, copy only the files from that diskette 
to your hard disk.  If you are sure that you want ANSI C, copy only 
the files from THAT diskette.  If you don't know which you want, 
then consult your compiler documentation.  If it makes no mention of 
ANSI C, then it is probably an older compiler that is only K&R, not 
ANSI, compatible.

You can also install BOTH dialects.  To do this, copy the complete set 
of files from one diskette into a folder on your hard disk, and then 
copy ONLY two StuffIt archive files (names ending with "sit") from 
the other diskette into the same folder .You DON'T need to recopy the 
archive named "Other", but it does no harm if you do (replacing the 
first copy).

If you use ANSI C Recipes you must be aware that the header files 
nr.h and nrutil.h, and the utility files nrutil.c and complex.c, all 
supplied in the "Other" archive, incorporate both ANSI C and K&R C 
versions.  To make the ANSI versions active, you must be 
sure that one of the following macros is defined at compile 
time: ANSI, __STDC__, NRANSI.

Consult your compiler documentation to learn how to define macros 
at compile time.  Most ANSI compilers will automatically define 
__STDC__ if you specify that you want ANSI C conformity.

As further backup, all the ANSI C files on this diskette themselves 
internally #define NRANSI before accessing the header files nr.h or 
nrutil.h.  You can also do this in your own programs.  If you run into 
trouble, it is probably because you have referenced one of these 
header files in your own program (or compiled nrutil.c or complex.c) 
without the required #define NRANSI or compiler switch.

If you have a traditional or K&R C compiler, you need not (in fact, 
must not) define any special macros at compile time.

Incidentally, there are also separate versions of the programs 
nrutil.c and complex.c in the respective ANSI and K&R archives.  
These versions are specific to the dialect of the archive that 
contains them.

Although it is perfectly possible to mix-and-match ANSI and K&R C 
files in a single program, doing so can be quite tricky.  Don't attempt 
it unless you are an expert.

5.  TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON QUESTIONS

Q. I have tried it several times, but the UnStuffIt utility just does 
not work on my machine.

A. Write immediately to Numerical Recipes Software, P.O. Box 243, 
Cambridge, MA 02238 (USA) or fax to 617-863-1739.  Include your 
telephone or fax number and tell us when we can reach you.  We 
really want to know about this!

Q. What version of C is used in this diskette?

Two diskettes are supplied, one for K&R (traditional) C, and the 
other for ANSI (modern) C.

The procedures on the two diskettes are intended to work with all C 
compilers for the Macintosh.  The programs in the "K&R" archives are 
written in "textbook Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R) C", and do not make 
specific reference to Macintosh system calls.  The programs in the 
"ANSI" archives are in textbook ANSI C.  Among the many C compilers 
for Macintosh, we recommend Symantec Corporation's Think C (which 
is ANSI C conformant), and Apple Computer's MPW C (which supports 
K&R C and, at time of writing, many, but not all, ANSI features). You 
may need to make minor modifications of the procedures with these 
and other compilers when including them in your Macintosh-specific 
application.

For more information, please read Section 2 of this file, which 
discusses the difference between K&R and ANSI C. 

Q.  My diskette is defective!

A.  If you believe that this diskette is defective in manufacture, 
return it to the place of purchase for replacement, or contact 
Cambridge University Press at the address given below.

Q.  I have both the FORTRAN and C diskettes.  Can I install them onto 
the same machine?

A.  Yes, but it is best if you copy their respective files into different 
folders.  If you must copy all the files into a single folder, be sure to 
rename the "NR Help" files (HyperCard stack and text documents) to 
have unique names, BEFORE you copy them into a folder.  Otherwise, 
the help files for the second diskette will overwrite those of the 
first.  The archives themselves all have unique names and can all 
share a single copy of UnStuffIt.

Q. What happened to the old Numerical Recipes Example Diskettes? 

A. See the topic "How to use the Example programs," below.

Q. What happened to Numerical Recipes in Pascal? BASIC?

A. The Second Edition of Numerical Recipes is available in C and 
FORTRAN.  Due to lack of demand, we have not prepared a Second 
Edition version of the Pascal version.  However, the First Edition of 
Numerical Recipes in Pascal continues to be available.  Ditto, BASIC.

Q. How do I contact Numerical Recipes Software?

A. See the first question above for our address and fax number. 
Sorry, we don't take phone calls other than fax.

6.  HOW TO USE THE EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

The Numerical Recipes Example Books (in C and FORTRAN), published 
by Cambridge University Press, contain descriptions and listings of 
sample programs that demonstrate and exercise all of the Numerical 
Recipes routines.  In previous editions, these demonstration 
programs were available, machine-readable, only as a separate 
diskette.  Now, they are included, free, on this diskette.  You can try 
out these demonstration programs without having the Example Book 
itself. However, to get the maximum benefit of these examples, you 
will want to read the Example Book's additional descriptions and see 
the sample output.  Information on ordering the the Example Book 
was given above.

The Example programs all have names beginning with "X". They must 
be compiled with, and/or linked to, the routines that they 
demonstrate. Some of the Example programs also use data files that 
are supplied on this diskette in the "Other" archive.  (See below for a 
list of these files.  Also, see below for a list of all the Example 
programs.)  To find out what routines and/or data files are required 
by an Example program, read its program listing. 

For instance, the Example program XSVDCMP.C (in the Demos archive) 
must be compiled and linked with the Recipes SVDCMP.C and 
PYTHAG.C (in the Recipes archive), and reads data from the file 
MATRX3.DAT (in the Other archive).

The Example programs are all self-prompting at run time.  Just 
follow their instructions.
