# Perform daily backups of system volumes

# Arguments are volume_name backup_size buffer_size

# backup_size: This currently only has an effect the  first time
# the script is run. These were the values on that first run.
# In future it would be nice to adapt the backup-vm-cairo script to 
# automatically expand the backup volumes if instructed to here.
# For now this must be done manually when necessary.
